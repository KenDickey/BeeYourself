Got HV via AliExpress: ~$25

WORKING IMAGE

Not having access to Windows/Intel, I found a Debiamn image referenced on the INet at page:

  https://popolon.org/gblog3/?p=2261&lang=en


Used Raspian Linux on RasPi4 to flash 32GB SD card via:

 sudo dd if=20211230_LicheeRV_debian_d1_hdmi_8723ds.ddimg  of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress conv=sync

Used same power/HDMI/usb-keyboard+mouse.

Booted fine.

* Login: sipeed
* Password: licheepi

Right-click to change desktop setting to add menus.

No networking (locked up ap from menu: Settings->Connman).

GETTING NETWORKING UP

I needed a text editor.  So got mg and ncurses.  
  https://github.com/troglobit/mg
  https://invisible-mirror.net/archives/ncurses/

tar'ed sw on RasPi4/Raspian; mounted SD card for Riscv64; copied to card; reinsert into LicheeRV; reboot.
Then built on rv64/debian.

With text editor, edited /etc/wifi/wpa_supplicant.config for router wifi name & wpa-psk password.
Also edited /etc/network/interfaces as per popolon's web page.
+reboot

Now use 
  sudo ifconfig
to get IP and can
  ssh sipeed@<IP>
for remote terminal 

(AdaFruit USB Console also works with same pin positions

GIT/APT et al

Edited /etc/apt/filelist as per Debian
Needed to install keys
  dpkg -i debian-ports-archive-keyring_2022.02.15_all.deb

so
  sudo apt-get install git
  sudo apt-get install dillo
..

That is the basics..
